# Pomodoro App

ðŸš§ **This project is currently under active development. Features, structure, and design may change frequently.**  

A simple pomodoro timer built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The application allows you to track focused work and break sessions, categorise each session with tags and review basic statistics.

## Features

- **Work and break modes** &ndash; switch automatically or manually between focus and rest.
- **Custom durations** &ndash; configure the minutes for each mode when the timer is paused.
- **Tag selector** &ndash; create and assign activity tags to your sessions.
- **Session history and summary** &ndash; stored locally so statistics are preserved between visits.
- **Dark themed interface** with a responsive layout.
